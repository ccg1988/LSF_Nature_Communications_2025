Those are the raw data and MATLAB codes for generating all Main figures in the manuscript.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5%%%%%%%%%%%% How to use the codes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Unzip those files and run each program.
Each program is independent and will load its raw data for plotting.
Each program will generate a .pdf file that is publishable (aka not need Adobe Illustrator or other pdf editing software). 
Each program calls functions (tiledlayout and nexttile) for organizing the figures.
Since those two functions are introduced in MATLAB2019b, programs wouldn't work in previous MATLAB versions.
However, you can replace those two functions with older functions like 'subplot' with minor modifications.

I have run, commented and checked those codes before uploading (Jun 5th, 2022, MATLAB2022a). 
Feel free to contact me if you have any issues.
