We have uploaded the raw spiking data (not firing rate) that could be used to reproduce Figure 1-6 and Supplementary Figure 2-8. 

We used an online template matching method to isolate high-quality single-unit signals, therefore we don't need a further spike sorting process.

Readers could also use those raw data for other analyses. We did not present all of our analyzed results since we already have 21 Figures.

*****************************

We did not upload the raw waveform of action potential (unrelated to this study) and membrane potential (Figure 6) due to the file size limit (<25 MB).

Figure 7 does not need experimental data and the codes are contained in three folders: Membrane_potential_depolarization (Fig7a), Ex_In_Syn_Amplitude_Grid_Search (Fig7c), Scaled_membrane_potential_depolarization (Fig7d, e, f)

Due to the file size limit, we did not upload the raw behavioral tracking video of Figure 8. We uploaded three example videos as the Supplemental Videos.
